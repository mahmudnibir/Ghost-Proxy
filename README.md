# GoLogin_auto_proxy
This code automates the process of running proxy profiles through GoLogin. You can simply run the code, but ensure that GoLogin is open and on the homepage before starting. The code will automatically add profiles, paste proxies from the "proxy.txt" file, and insert the link into each profile. After running the profile, it will click on all the links within the profiles. Once the website has loaded, it will click on the website as well.

Make sure that the coordinates for clicking on the website are set according to your PC or laptop. After completing all tasks, if you say "delete all," the code will automatically close and delete the profiles in GoLogin.
